This is an algo trading introductory course by freeCodeCamp, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y3yaoi9rUQ&t=2483s

Notes:
- algorithmic trading follows a predefined set of rules.
- supervised ML can be used for signal generation/risk management through prediction, while unsupervised learning can be used for extracting insights from the data (patterns, relationships and structures)
- challenges when applying ML in trading: reflexivity (at some point someone will find your arbitrage opportunity and your strategy will stop working)

Workflow:
1. collect and prepare the data
2. develop a hypothesis for a strategy
3. code the model
4. backtest the strategy
